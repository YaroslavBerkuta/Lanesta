== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If you've recently updated your titles and description, Google probably hasn't indexed them just yet. It can take up to a week for Google to index changes you’ve made.

Use the “New Crawl” button in the sitemap tab to notify Google of any changes to your site. The Google cache will update when your site has be recrawled. Be patient, it can take some time for the new information to show.

SmartCrawl works with any normal WP content and page builders shouldn’t be an exception. As long as your theme uses posts, pages and custom post types, SmartCrawl will work.
